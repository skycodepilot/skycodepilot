- 👋 Hi, I’m @skycodepilot
- 👀 I’m interested in ... software development, Raspberry Pi, and retro videogames
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... old things (WCF), new things (.NET 8, vertical slice architecture, RabbitMQ, and MediatR)
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate (not *just* yet)
- 📫 Stay tuned for additional content!
- ⚡ Fun fact: "Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A" is one of the most famous video game cheat codes in the world! It was popularized for its use in the Nintendo Entertainment System game "Contra", but that's not the only game it's used in.
